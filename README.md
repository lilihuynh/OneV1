Wager Me App
The motivation for the app:
Our application is a friendly wager application that resolves the endless banter that goes on behind the scenes. “Wager me” is an interactive dashboard which allows for users to make posts regarding a unique wager they want to pose. This can be seen as a Twitter dashboard where users can post: “1v1 Call of Duty” and upload that challenge to be seen on the main dashboard containing a list of other posts. Given a user sees a challenge they wish to accept, he/she can click on the post, which will bring up a small window describing the “wager” and allowing the user to click accept. Upon accepting, the user would then be prompted with their in game username to be able to add each other. After the match is finished, both players would return to the application’s original wager post where they can upload the results via screenshots or by honest submissions (example: Clicking a “won” or “loss” button).
The stakes are:
Upon registration to the application, each user is given 50 “wager” points which they can use to bet. These points in future development can be used as a reward by exchanging the points for in-game rewards or allowing users to buy more “wager” points if they so happen to run out from losing too many or all their wagers.
